# Get your artifacts and environments information from Kosli

All the information stored in Kosli may be helpful both for operations and development. A set of `get`, `ls`, `log` and `inspect` commands allows you to quickly access the information about your environments, artifacts and deployments, without leaving your development environment.

The same CLI you use to record and connect your changes can be use to search for and browse information in Kosli.
