# What is Kosli


<!-- 
TODO: Provide a better description of what Kosli is
-->
Broken environments. Services down. Manual changes leaking into your environment. A lot can go wrong, but Kosli records a connected history of your devops, so you don't have to spend hours wondering about the source of change.

Use Kosli [Environments](/what_is_kosli/environments) to report and track what's running in your runtime environments, and Kosli [Pipelines](/what_is_kosli/pipelines) to report your artifacts and events around them. Both Environments and Pipelines in Kosli belong to an [Organization](/what_is_kosli/organizations).
