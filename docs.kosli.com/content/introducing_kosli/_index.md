# What is Kosli

**Record**, **connect** and **search** every change from commit to production.

## Why?

Broken environments. Services down. Manual changes leaking into your environment. A lot can go wrong, but Kosli records a connected history of your devops, so you don't have to spend hours wondering about the source of change.

Use Kosli [Environments](/introducing_kosli/environments) to report and track what's running in your runtime environments, and Kosli [Pipelines](/introducing_kosli/pipelines) to report your artifacts and events around them. Both Environments and Pipelines in Kosli belong to an [Organization](/introducing_kosli/organizations).
