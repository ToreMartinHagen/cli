# How to

## Record

Kosli records the status of runtime environments by detecting artifacts running in any given environment and reporting the information.

If the list of running artifacts is different than what was reported previously, a new snapshot is created which is immutable and tamper proof.

## Connect 

Report artifact creation and connect your development world of commits, builds, tests, approvals and deployments with what’s happening in operations.

Kosli records the sha of each build artifact, its source commit, history, and any other CI build information.

## Search

A set of get, ls, log and inspect commands allows you to quickly access the information about your environments, artifacts and deployments, without leaving your development environment.

Search and browse with the same CLI you use to record and connect your changes, or use Kosli’s web application.
