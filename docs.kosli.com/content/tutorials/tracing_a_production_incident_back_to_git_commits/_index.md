<!-- Create a SECOND tutorial for: 
     2. Title?=Tracing a production incident back to git commits
        The stories here would be simulated incidents with Easter-eggs comments.

<!-- 
Assume that we are continuing after the following a git commit so we don't need to
explain what cyber dojo is.

During xx we detected that yy did not work.

We diff what was running at that point in time with the previous snapshot

We see that `runner` has changed and the new artifact is zz.

From the artifact we can find the git commit that was used for this build.

We should be able to find out which commit was used for building the previous
version of this artifact.

We now have two git commits and we know that the bug was introduced between those
two commits.
