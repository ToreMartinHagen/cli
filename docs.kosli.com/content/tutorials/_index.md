# Tutorials

Kosli stores information about the software you build in CI pipelines
and run in your runtime environment. The Kosli CLI is used for reporting
and querying the information.

Typically all the reporting will be done as part of your CI and runtime systems.
To getting started you don't need any of this. 
Local code, git and a terminal are enough.

The `kosli` CLI is tool agnostic and can run on any major platform 
(Linux, Mac, Windows). Kosli does not require you to change your existing 
process.

The purpose of this tutorial is to familiarize you with the Kosli CLI and concepts.

<!--
When you are done with the guide you should be able to start adding Kosli to
your CI system and runtime environment.
