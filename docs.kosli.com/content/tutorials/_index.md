# Tutorials

These tutorials will familiarize you with the Kosli CLI and its concepts.

Kosli stores information about the software you build in your CI pipelines 
and run in your runtime environment. The Kosli CLI is used for reporting and 
querying the information.

Typically, all the reporting will be done as part of your CI and runtime systems. 
To get started you won't need any of this. Local code, git and a terminal are enough.

The `kosli` CLI is tool agnostic and can run on any major platform 
(Linux, Mac, Windows). Kosli does not require you to change your existing 
process.

Letâ€™s get started!

<!--
When you are done with the guide you should be able to start adding Kosli to
your CI system and runtime environment.
